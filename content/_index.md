## About {#about}
<div class="about">
  I am an Applied Scientist and a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at DePaul University. My current research in intelligent systems is grounded in my extensive industry background as a software engineer, which informs my approach to building robust, scalable, and maintainable models. 
  My current research and development centers on architecting LLM-powered AI agents for dynamic and explainable user modeling within recommender systems. Leveraging my foundation in reinforcement learning and deep learning, I build these systems to enhance personalization while ensuring a high degree of model transparency.

## Applied Research & Engineering {#research}

<div class="research">
My work involves the research and development of intelligent systems designed for adaptivity, transparency, and efficacy in real-world environments. My approach is centered on three core areas of research and application:
</div>

### Personalization & Recommender Systems
<div class="research">
My research in this area focuses on developing recommendation models with a more robust understanding of user preferences. I construct hybrid architectures that integrate both relational and contextual data to effectively model complex, temporal user behavior. This research also addresses the challenge of satisfying competing objectives within a recommendation platform, for which I develop multi-objective optimization algorithms to generate more balanced and effective outcomes.
</div>

### Intelligent Decision & Optimization Systems
<div class="research">
My work in this domain involves engineering autonomous systems that learn and adapt in dynamic environments. Using reinforcement learning, I develop algorithms designed to optimize for long-term objectives by making sequential decisions based on user interaction data. This methodology is applicable to problems such as optimizing personalized incentive strategies and managing dynamic user engagement.
</div>

### LLM-Powered AI Agents & Explainable AI
<div class="research">
My current research investigates the application of LLM-powered AI agents for user modeling. I am developing methods where these agents are utilized to construct sophisticated and dynamic representations of user behavior, with the goal of improving personalization. A core objective of this research is to advance Explainable AI (XAI). By designing agent prompts that elicit transparent, human-readable rationales for model outputs, I work towards systems that are both effective and inherently auditable, a central theme in my published research.
